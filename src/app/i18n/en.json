However, it is our common values, the highest level of respect for one another and unconditional love that bonds us so strongly.  From the first day I met Joao, I knew he was my soulmate.

Dating back to the 16th century, this baroque style church at the summit of the hill in the village of Porches, known as Igreja de Nossa Senhora da Encarnação, has beautiful azulejo tile installed throughout in its nave, complemented by a gilded carved wood altar. Dedicated to Mary, it has a special significance for Joao, who was born on the feast day of Our Lady."

The sprawling manicured gardens, dotted with tropical flora and exquisite water features, stretch from the rear of the reception towards the Atlantic Ocean, eventually giving way to the coastal sandstone cliffs for which the Algarve region is famous, which, in turn, offers up a secluded private beach. We cannot wait to celebrate our union with you in this idyllic piece of paradise!"
